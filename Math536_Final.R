##Analysis 1
#1.	Iâ€™ve always believed that umpires are more likely to call a fringe pitch as 
#a strike if there are already 3 balls on the batter.  
#Assess whether or not the count (number of strikes and number of balls) impacts 
#the probability of a strike being called if all pitch conditions are comparable.

##Define our Cases:
bball2[ , "cases"] = ""

#Less than 3 Balls or Do not have any 3 Balls
bball2[bball2$balls<3,]$cases= "Not3"

#3 Balls and 2 Strikes
bball2[bball2$balls==3 & bball2$strikes==2,]$cases="3B&2S"

#3 Balls less than 2 Strikes
bball2[bball2$balls==3 & bball2$strikes<2,]$cases="3B&LTS"

##Define Euclidean Distance from the Center
